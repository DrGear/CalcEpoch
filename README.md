# CalcEpoch

Ported from Ilaria_RVC into an Applio plugin, this will calculate the estimated amount of time to train a model based on the epochs and the seconds per epoch.

# To install:
1. Download the zip file.
2. With Applio open, go to the "Plugins' tab.
3. Drag and drop the zip into the file uploader. The web app will automatically unzip and apply the plugin upon reloading the web app.



`Applio is made by Blaise, for any issues with the web app itself, please contact him, I am not affiliated with Applio, this is just a plugin for the program.`
